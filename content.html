<h1>Bundi Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 2025</p>
<p>Thank you for using <strong>Bundi</strong>. Your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>
<h2>1) Information We Collect</h2>
<p><strong>Account Information.</strong> Email, username, and profile details you provide.</p>
<p><strong>Messages &amp; Media.</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Direct messages and attachments you send.  </li>
<li>Messages are encrypted in transit and at rest. Where supported, one-to-one messages use end-to-end encryption so only sender and recipient can read them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Duplicate-Image Detection Data.</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>To stop spam, when you upload an image we compute a <strong>non-reversible fingerprint (perceptual hash)</strong> of the image.  </li>
<li>The same image may be uploaded <strong>twice</strong>; a <strong>third</strong> attempt is <strong>blocked</strong> automatically.  </li>
<li>We store the fingerprint and minimal counters needed to enforce this rule. We do <strong>not</strong> share these fingerprints with third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Device &amp; Usage Data.</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>App/version, OS, crash logs, diagnostics, and aggregated usage (e.g., feature usage counts).  </li>
<li>We do <strong>not</strong> use this data for cross-app tracking or advertising.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2) How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>Provide core messaging features and improve performance and reliability.  </li>
<li>Detect and block duplicate images (anti-spam/abuse).  </li>
<li>Troubleshoot, support, and secure the service (fraud/abuse detection, rate-limiting).  </li>
<li>Communicate service notices (e.g., changes to terms, privacy, or incidents).</li>
</ul>
<h2>3) Permissions We Request (and Why)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Camera</strong> ‚Äî <em>We use your camera so you can take and upload photos (e.g., a profile picture or a photo to share in chat).</em>  </li>
<li><strong>Photo Library</strong> ‚Äî <em>We use your photo library so you can choose images to share in chat or set a profile picture.</em>  </li>
<li><strong>Photo Library Add</strong> (if you offer ‚ÄúSave to Photos‚Äù) ‚Äî <em>We save photos to your library only when you ask us to download or export media.</em>  </li>
<li><strong>Notifications (optional)</strong> ‚Äî To alert you about new messages. You can change your decision any time in iOS Settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>We request each permission <strong>only when needed</strong>, and you can change or revoke permissions in your device settings.</p>
<h2>4) Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your data. We share data only:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>With service providers</strong> who host, store, or process data on our instructions and under contract (e.g., cloud infrastructure, crash analytics).  </li>
<li><strong>For legal compliance</strong> when required by law or valid legal process.  </li>
<li><strong>For security</strong> to detect, prevent, or address fraud, abuse, or technical issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5) Data Security</h2>
<p>We use encryption, access controls, and industry-standard safeguards. No method is 100% secure, but we continuously improve our protections.</p>
<h2>6) Data Retention</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Messages &amp; Media:</strong> retained to provide the service (e.g., your chat history) until you delete them or delete your account.  </li>
<li><strong>Duplicate-Image Fingerprints:</strong> retained as long as necessary to enforce the duplicate-blocking rule and protect the service, and deleted when no longer needed or upon account deletion.  </li>
<li><strong>Diagnostics:</strong> retained for a limited period to troubleshoot and improve stability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>7) Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delete Account &amp; Data:</strong> Use <strong>Settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Delete Account</strong> (if available) or contact us (see below).  </li>
